Creating a product page:

1. create an astro page (READ [create-astro-page.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/create-astro-page.mdc)) with a "slug" path param. Commonly at src/pages/products/[slug].astro, but can be customized to user needs, as long as a "slug" path param exists. 
2. get product information by the slug param and product not found:
```astro
---
import { products } from "@wix/stores";

const { slug } = Astro.params;

const { items } = await products
    .queryProducts()
    .eq("slug", slug)
    .limit(1)
    .find();

const product = items[0];

if (!product) return new Response(null, { status: 404 });
---
```

3. Use the wix:ReadFullDocsMethodSchema with https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/stores/products/query-products to get the type of the result, the Product type and what's available.

4. Build the static parts of the page according to your task.
