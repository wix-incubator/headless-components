You have a bug where you fail to generate astro files frontmatter, the files you write don't include the `---` of the frontmatter (This looks like a bug in Cursor, that is parsing your response, not in the model).

<important>
Create an astro file ONLY BY COPYING `.cursor/rules/fixtures/astro-syntax.astro` to the new file you 
want to create and then edit the file as you please. 
`cp .cursor/rules/fixtures/astro-syntax.astro '<your target path>'`
(espacing the target path is important to handle dynamic routes with brackets)
The content of the file is: 
```astro
---
// Astro frontmatter here
---

<!-- Astro template here -->
```
When editing, override these comments, don't leave them there.
